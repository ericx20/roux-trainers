## Awesome Roux trainers.
- FB + DR random state generator and optimal solver.
- FB trainer with customizations like solved DL/BL edge and tough cases when there is no pair.
- SS random state generator and optimal solver using <R, r, U>.
- Random-state CMLL trainer with OCLL case selection and optional SB trigger.
- M and r move powered overall.
- Up to 25 different solutions generated, sorted by a finger-friendliness metric.
- Inspired by http://cubegrass.appspot.com/, but with everything that it is missing.

Version Log:
(v1.0.0) All work prior to 12/02/2020.
(v1.0.1) 12/02/2020: Add edge position control for FB Last Pair trainer.
(v1.1) 12/15/2020: Reworked UI. App bar now features a dropdown menu for selecting the mode. Scramble occupies its own row. Solutions are shown side by side with the sim cube in large screen.
(v1.2) 12/17/2020: Add support for scramble input for all modes. Now you can paste in a list of scrambles, and the trainer will consume them one by one in order.
(v1.3) 12/20/2020: Solve Analysis Beta is online! It can do the following:
    - For any random scramble, it'll recommend the best FB solutions over all orientations (e.g. x2y yellow/white). 
    - Given a solve reconstruction, it'll analyze each stage, and compare your solution there with the solver-suggested solutions.
(v1.4) 12/23/2020: Refine the appearance of the virtual cube and enable camera control with mouse dragging.
