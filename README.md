# Onionhoney's Roux Trainers
- A trainer collection that caters to all your Roux training needs  ❤️
- Inspired by http://cubegrass.appspot.com/, but with everything that it is missing.
 

## Modes supported
- FB analyzer
    - Solves for all x2y FBs, and suggests the best FB to start with!
    - Other orientations supported too (CN, b/g x2y, etc.)
- FB last slot (+ DR) trainer 
    - `HIGHLY USEFUL` if you're learning FB or FB + DR. Get a random scramble, think on your own, and check with our solutions!
    - **Note**: while I try my best, the solver can still miss out on the best overall solution. So please, consult your human fellows when you're unsure, and always be careful with what you choose to learn.
- FS/FB/SS trainer 
    - You can specify by piece positions. It seems these modes are pretty useful in providing new insights into blockbuilding  (for us dumb humans).
- CMLL trainer 
    - Truly random scrambles so you can't tell the cases. You can specify different OCLLs. You can even start with a random SB last pair (to simulate how real recognition works)
- LSE trainers (EOLR, 4c)
    - Good for reviewing EOLR and practicing your 4c recognition method. You can filter by MC/Non-MC cases too.


## Functionalities
- Scrambles are all random state. Solver is Roux-optimized with M and r moves as first-class citizens, with up to 25 different solutions provided.

- You can control the virtual cube with keyboard (CStimer mapping). You can also drag on the cube to change its perspective.

- You can bookmark your favorite cases and these will be saved in your browser.

- You can input your own scrambles as a list and our trainer will drain them one by one!

- Appearance: dark mode enabled.

## Version Log 
- (v1.0.0) All work prior to 12/02/2020, which I forgot to version log for.

- (v1.3) 12/20/2020: Solve Analysis Beta is online! It can do the following:
    - For any random scramble, it'll recommend the best FB solutions over all orientations (e.g. x2y yellow/white). 
    - Given a solve reconstruction, it'll analyze each stage, and compare your solution there with the solver-suggested solutions.

    - We added a case selection menu to help you pick cases conveniently.
    - We also let you select cases based on the L/R face shape, to assist users of NMCLL-based recognition methods. As usual, we're the first ever trainer to do so.

    - Add LEVEL SELECTION. 
    - Add FBLP + SS Trainer mode.
